This program is a Student Record Management System made in C. It stores student details (roll number, name, and marks) in a text file.
Users can log in as admin, staff, user, or guest, and each role has different options.
Admin can add, view, search, update, and delete student records.
Staff can add, view, search, and update records.
User can only view all students.
Guest can view and search for a student.
The system reads login details from a credentials file and shows a menu based on the user’s role. It uses simple file handling to manage all student data.
